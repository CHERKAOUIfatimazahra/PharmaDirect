## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline is configured for the backend service with the following stages:

### Backend Pipeline

1. **Testing Stage**
   - Runs on Ubuntu latest
   - Sets up Node.js 18
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs unit tests
   - Performs ESLint checks

2. **Build and Push Stage**
   - Triggers after successful tests
   - Only runs on main branch pushes
   - Builds Docker image
   - Pushes to Docker Hub
   - Uses build cache for faster builds

3. **Deployment Stage**
   - Triggers after successful build
   - Only runs on main branch pushes
   - Deploys to production server via SSH
   - Updates Docker container

### Pipeline Triggers

The pipeline is triggered on:
- Push to main branch (affecting backend files)
- Pull requests to main branch (affecting backend files)

### Environment Requirements

The following secrets need to be configured in GitHub:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token
- `DEPLOY_HOST`: Production server hostname
- `DEPLOY_USER`: SSH username
- `DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH private key
